# ICD Coding Benchmark
Automatic ICD coding benchmark based on the MIMIC dataset.

**NOTE: ðŸš§ The repo is under construction. Please see below for available datasets/models.**

Automatic diagnosis coding[^1] in clinical NLP is a task to predict the diagnoses and the procedures during a hospital stay given the summary of the stay (discharge summary).
The labels of the task are mostly represented in ICD (international classification of disease) codes which are alpha-numeric codes widely adopted by hospitals in the US.
The most popular database used in automatic diagnosis coding is the MIMIC-III dataset, but the preprocessing varies among the literatures and some of them are done incorrectly.
Such inconsistency and error makes it hard to compare different methods on automatic diagnosis coding and, arguably, results in incorrect evaluation on the methods.

This code repository aims to provide a standardized benchmark of automatic diagnosis coding with the MIMIC-III database.
The benchmark encompasses all the procedures of ICD coding, dataset generation, model training/evaluation, and interative web demo.

We currently provide (items in parentheses are under development):
- Four preset of preprocessed datasets: MIMIC-III full, top-50, full (old), top-50 (old), where we referred to (old) as the version of CAML[^2].
- ICD coding models: CNN, CAML, DCAN, (MultiResCNN, LAAT, KSI)
- (Interative demo)

## Preparation
Please put the MIMIC-III `csv.gz` files (v1.4) under `datasets/mimic3/csv`. You can also create symbolic links pointing the files.

## Pre-processing
Please run the following command to generate the MIMIC-III top-50 dataset, or generate other versions using the config files in `configs/preprocessing`.
```
$ python run_preprocessing.py --config_path configs/preprocessing/mimic3_50.yml
```

## Training / Testing
Please run the following command to train, or resume training of, the CAML model on the MIMIC-III top-50 dataset. You can evaluate the model with `--test` options and use other config files under `configs`.
```
$ python run.py --config_path configs/caml_mimic3_50.yml         # Train
$ python run.py --config_path configs/caml_mimic3_50.yml --test  # Test
```
